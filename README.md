Electric Utilities report a huge amount of information to government and public agencies. They include very granular data on fuel burned, electricity generated, power plant usage patterns, plant capacity factors and emissions from greenhouse gases.
In this Project, we will explore the operating costs of individual power plants, see how fuel costs impact the viability of the different generation sources, highlight the competitiveness of renewable electricity and show how the generation mix of different utilities evolved overtime.
